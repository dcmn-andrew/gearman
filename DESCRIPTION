Description: gearman provides a reference class interface to the Gearman Job
   server. gearman links to the libgearman C library and currently exposes
   the client API, allowing R users to submit jobs to Gearman Job servers. A
   future version may expose the worker API, thus allowing users to place R
   jobs within the server... callable by any gearman-enabled client.
